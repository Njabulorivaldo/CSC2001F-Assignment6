Using directed graphs to develop a simulation of a very cheap taxi service offered by supermarket chain QnQ. This service is cost-effective for QnQ partly because taxis follow only some limited routes through the city. 
• Taxis are stationed at QnQ shops. 
• Clients are people who ask for a QnQ taxi to take them from a QnQ pickup spot to the nearest QnQ shop. 
• Edges in the graph represent routes the taxis take, modelled as a weighted directed graph. 
• As the fare for the taxi is a set price, clients are only taken to the nearest QnQ shop. 
• To minimise costs, the nearest taxi must go to the client’s pickup spot, and from there it must take the client to the nearest QnQ shop
